# Contributing Guidelines:

We welcome all contributions to the GATK project. The contribution can be a [issue report](https://github.com/devcer/CapShun/issues) 
or a [pull request](https://github.com/devcer/CapShun/pulls).

## Contribution workflow:


1. Check that there isn't [already an issue](https://github.com/devcer/CapShun/issues) about your idea to avoid duplicating work.
    * If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this
2. Fork the [devcer/CapShun repository](https://github.com/devcer/CapShun) to your GitHub account
3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository
4. Submit a Pull Request against the `master` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged.

If you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [basic docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
